BG3 Subclass Patcher
Overview
BG3 Subclass Patcher is a Python application designed to dynamically create .pak files that merge Progressions.lsx from selected mods, thereby making them compatible. While the primary focus has been on Subclass mods, the tool is built to be extensible for other types as well. Use at your own risk and always backup your files before installing patches.

Features
Dynamic Patching: Seamlessly merges Progressions.lsx files from multiple mods.
Subclass Support: Specifically tested for Subclass mods but designed for extensibility.
User-Friendly UI: Simple interface for easy navigation and operation.

Usage
No installation required
Run bg3subclasspatcher.exe to start the application.
Select the mods you wish to patch.
Click the "Create Patch" button.

WARNING
The app removes any temporary files after closing, this is so it doesnt bloat your temp files, so if you want to keep the patch move it somewhere else.

This tool is not officially supported or endorsed. Use it at your own risk and always backup your files before making any changes.
